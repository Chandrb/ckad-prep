Create a pod, assign the name nginx-pod.   Use the nginx image and add the label “app” with a value of “nginx”.  Allow Internet access on port 80 and verify you can get to the page from your local browser.


Create 10 Pods that need a minimum of a quarter of a CPU and 256 MB of ram for each. Make sure they are all scheduled on the SAME node, until there isn't enough room available on that node. Then allow them to be scheduled on other nodes.


Create a pod with nginx container exposed at port 80.   Add a busybox init container that downloads a page using "wget -O /work-dir/index.html http://neverssl.com/online".  Make a volume of type emptyDir and mount it in both containers.  For the nginx container, mount it on "/usr/share/nginx/html" and for the initcontainer, mount it on "/work-dir".  When done, get the IP of the created pod and create a busybox pod and run "wget -O- IP".   Expose your pod to the Internet and make sure you can access it from a browser.


This question is a little more difficult, but not impossible.  You should expect questions like this on the exam.

Using a cluster with at least 3 nodes, create a StatefulSet with 3 replicas using the nginx image and expose port 80.  Ensure that each pod creates a 4 Gig Azure Disk and mounts it to a folder called "/usr/ss".  Ensure that each pod is created on a DIFFERENT node!  Access any of the pods from your local machine at the following URL: http://localhost:8100.
